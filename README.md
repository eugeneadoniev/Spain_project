Project of customers' clustering 
The goal of this project is to split the existing customers of the online store into clusters. 
The criteria by which the breakdown occurs: the amount of purchases, the frequency of purchases, the recency of purchases.
The resulting clusters of buyers are subsequently used for marketing purposes. 
Customer data has been pre-processed, cleaned and normalized. 
Clustering (non-supervising machine learning) was performed using the Scikit-learn package using clustering method K-means. 
Also dbscan, SOM, Gaussian clustering methods are used.
The accuracy was assessed by metrics from the Scikit-learn package.
